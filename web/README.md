### How It Works
The advance payment system tracks **liability** - showing how much of the paid work has actually been completed.

**Example Scenario:**
1. Worker completes 1 day of work (‚Çπ25 earned)
2. Employer pays ‚Çπ50 advance (covers 2 days of work)
3. System shows: **"‚Çπ50 paid, 1/2 days"**
4. Meaning: 1 day completed out of 2 days paid for
5. Worker owes 1 more day to clear the advance
